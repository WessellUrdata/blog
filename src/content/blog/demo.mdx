import WeatherInfo from "../../components/Weather/WeatherInfo.astro";
import WeatherCard from "../../components/Weather/WeatherCard.astro";

import Jyutping from "../../components/Jyutping.astro";

This is just a little playground to test if I can get what I want to use for my blog working.

## Twemoji :left_speech_bubble::bird:

I've set up Twemoji injection a long while ago, but here it is:

:relaxed:🫂:bangbang:

PS: I've also set up [remark-emoji](https://github.com/rhysd/remark-emoji) to make typing emoji less of a pain. `:people_hugging:` doesn't work right now and I'll look into it when I'm free.

## LaTeX ☝️🤓

Here's the (in)famous Euler's formula written using [remark-math](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-math/tree/main/packages/remark-math) and [rehype-katex](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-math/tree/main/packages/rehype-katex).

$$
e^{j\pi} = \cos x + j \sin x
$$

## Syntax Highlighting 🖊️ & Image support 🖼️ (It's there but I wanted to add some CSS)

Here's a code snippet I wrote for my assignment for EIE3331:

```python
  #!/usr/bin/env python3

  from numpy import pi, cos, linspace
  import matplotlib.pyplot as p

  ABCD = 5227 # last four digits of student ID to be sent

  t = linspace(start=0, stop=10**-4, num=10**4) # time range = [0, 10^-4]

  f_c = 10**6 # carrier frequency 10^6 Hz

  v_ct = 1000 * cos(2 * pi * f_c * t) # carrier signal v_c(t)

  f_m = 10**4 # message frequency 10^4 Hz
  mt = ABCD/1000 * cos(2 * pi * f_m * t) # message signal m(t)

  v_at = mt * v_ct # DSB-SC signal v_a(t)

  p.plot(t, v_at, color='k', linewidth=.5, clip_on=False)

  p.ticklabel_format(style='scientific', axis='both', scilimits=(0,0), useMathText=True) # make the tick labels look less ugly
  p.grid(visible=True, alpha=.5)
  p.margins(0)

  p.title('Waveform of DSB-SC signal $v_a(t)$ for $abcd = 5227$')
  p.xlabel('$t$')
  p.ylabel('Amplitude Level')

  p.savefig('q1.eps', bbox_inches='tight')
  p.show()
```

## Weather Cards 🏙️🌦️

I wrote some code to fetch weather data from the [Hong Kong Observatory](https://www.hko.gov.hk/en/index.html) a while ago dynamically. Since this website ships no JavaScript to the client, it's only rendered on the server and not updated client-side. Just keep that in mind.

It's quite a bit ugly right now, but it does work. I might come back and touch up on the CSS later.

<div class="not-prose flex flex-col mx-auto w-[360px]">
  Removed for the time being.
  {/* <WeatherInfo />
  <WeatherCard displayLocation="Hung Hom" API_URL="https://www.hko.gov.hk/PDADATA/locspc/data/gridData/0906_en.xml" /> */}
</div>

Turns out it's broken right now due to my sloppy spaghetti architecture. To be fixed Soon :relaxed: .

## Jyutping 🇭🇰🗣️

Some Jyutping injection! No JavaScript needed! Powered by [@CanCLID/to-jyutping](https://github.com/CanCLID/to-jyutping).

<input type="checkbox" class="toggle toggle-lg toggle-accent" id="jyutping-toggle" />

<Jyutping>
睇得明嘅話，同我講 「☺️‼️」啦！

{/* prettier-ignore */}
昔者:calendar:莊周👴夢💭為胡蝶🦋，栩栩然胡蝶🦋也！不知🤷周👴也。俄然覺😲，則蘧蘧然🥴周也👴。不知🤷周👴之夢💭為胡蝶🦋與，胡蝶🦋之夢💭為周👴與？

</Jyutping>

Note that the result is not perfect. For example, 與 was rendered as [`jyu5`](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%88%87#Pronunciation_1), but which should have been [`jyu4`](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%88%87#Pronunciation_3) in the literary/archaic sense.
