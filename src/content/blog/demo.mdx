This is just a little playground to test if I can get what I want to use for my blog working.

## Twemoji :left_speech_bubble::bird:

I've set up Twemoji injection a long while ago, but here it is:

:relaxed::people_hugging::bangbang:

PS: I've also set up [remark-emoji](https://github.com/rhysd/remark-emoji) to make typing emoji less of a pain. 🫂 `:people_hugging:` doesn't work right now and I'll look into it when I'm free.

PPS: It's caused by [emojilib](https://github.com/muan/emojilib). There's progress made by people far smarter than me done at Issue [muan/emojilib#194](https://github.com/muan/emojilib/issues/194) and Pull Request [muan/emojilib#226](https://github.com/muan/emojilib/pull/226) and it's quite encouraging.

## LaTeX ☝️🤓

Here's the (in)famous Euler's formula written using [remark-math](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-math/tree/main/packages/remark-math) and [rehype-katex](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-math/tree/main/packages/rehype-katex).

```math
e^{j \theta} = \cos \theta + j \sin \theta
```

### PS on 2024-07-01:

I've removed KaTeX CSS and opted to just use MathML with an increased font size. KaTeX's CSS bundle is quite large and since I'd probably write very little math on this website, it's best to keep it lightweight.

## Syntax Highlighting 🖊️ & Image support 🖼️ (It's there but I wanted to add some CSS)

Here's a code snippet I wrote for my assignment for EIE3331:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from numpy import pi, cos, linspace
import matplotlib.pyplot as p

ABCD = 5227 # last four digits of student ID to be sent

t = linspace(start=0, stop=10**-4, num=10**4) # time range = [0, 10^-4]

f_c = 10**6 # carrier frequency 10^6 Hz

v_ct = 1000 * cos(2 * pi * f_c * t) # carrier signal v_c(t)

f_m = 10**4 # message frequency 10^4 Hz
mt = ABCD/1000 * cos(2 * pi * f_m * t) # message signal m(t)

v_at = mt * v_ct # DSB-SC signal v_a(t)

p.plot(t, v_at, color='k', linewidth=.5, clip_on=False)

p.ticklabel_format(style='scientific', axis='both', scilimits=(0,0), useMathText=True) # make the tick labels look less ugly
p.grid(visible=True, alpha=.5)
p.margins(0)

p.title('Waveform of DSB-SC signal $v_a(t)$ for $abcd = 5227$')
p.xlabel('$t$')
p.ylabel('Amplitude Level')

p.savefig('q1.eps', bbox_inches='tight')
p.savefig('dsb-sc.svg', bbox_inches='tight')
p.show()
```

## Weather Cards 🏙️🌦️

I wrote some code to fetch weather data from the [Hong Kong Observatory](https://www.hko.gov.hk/en/index.html) a while ago dynamically. Since this website ships no JavaScript to the client, it's only rendered on the server and not updated client-side. Just keep that in mind.

It's quite a bit ugly right now, but it does work. I might come back and touch up on the CSS later.

import WeatherInfo from "../../components/Weather/WeatherInfo.astro";
import WeatherCard from "../../components/Weather/WeatherCard.astro";

<div class="not-prose flex flex-col mx-auto w-[360px]">
  Removed for the time being.
  {/* <WeatherInfo />
  <WeatherCard displayLocation="Hung Hom" API_URL="https://www.hko.gov.hk/PDADATA/locspc/data/gridData/0906_en.xml" /> */}
</div>

Turns out it's broken right now due to my sloppy spaghetti architecture. To be fixed Soon :relaxed: .

## Jyutping 🇭🇰🗣️

Some Jyutping injection! No JavaScript needed! Powered by [@CanCLID/to-jyutping](https://github.com/CanCLID/to-jyutping).

import Jyutping from "../../components/Jyutping.astro";

<input type="checkbox" class="toggle toggle-lg toggle-accent" id="jyutping-toggle" />

<Jyutping>
睇得明嘅話，同我講 「☺️‼️」啦！

{/* prettier-ignore */}
昔者:calendar:莊周👴夢💭為胡蝶🦋，栩栩然胡蝶🦋也！不知🤷周👴也。俄然覺😲，則蘧蘧然🥴周也👴。不知🤷周👴之夢💭為胡蝶🦋與，胡蝶🦋之夢💭為周👴與？

</Jyutping>

Note that the result is not perfect. For example, 與 was rendered as [`jyu5`](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%88%87#Pronunciation_1), but which should have been [`jyu4`](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%88%87#Pronunciation_3) in the literary/archaic sense.
