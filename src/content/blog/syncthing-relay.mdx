I've just set up some Syncthing relays, they're in the public pool so you may connect to one should you choose the default relay pool.

If you want to connect to my relays manually, use the following addresses:

- HK1: `relay://103.69.129.120:22067` (25 MB/s per session, 300 MB/s globally, subject to change)
- HK2: `relay://149.104.24.71:22067` (20 MB/s per session, 60 MB/s globally, subject to change)
