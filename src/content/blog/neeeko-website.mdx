If you've been wondering why there was a button on the footer with a dead link, it's because my friend Niko's website was down for several months since his server died (some sort of hardware failure if I remember correctly). Took him a while to get the server back on though, but it was *worth the wait*.

He's still in the process of editing some of the stuff (since he fetched the latest snapshot of his website from Wayback Machine), but do check it out nonetheless, it's good, quite ☺️, if you will..

import Button8831 from "../../components/Button8831.astro";

<Button8831 href="https://neeeko.com" src="/buttons/neeeko.png" alt="Button for neeeko's site" />

Update: It's broken again as of 2024-10-15 due to him moving the physical server to a new location. Sad! 😭🫂
